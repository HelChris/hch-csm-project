# Semester Project 1: Community Science Museum

### Brief:
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

You have been provided media assets as text and images. It is for you to decide how these will be used in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design.

Project Description Based on the first-semester curriculum, the semester project should reflect the studentâ€™s creative and technical knowledge and skills. This includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and development with HTML/CSS.
